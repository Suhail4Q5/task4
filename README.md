*DESCRIPTION*:This project is a basic speech recognition-based device control system. It allows users to control hardware devices, such as LEDs or relays, by speaking predefined voice commands. Designed for embedded platforms, this system is simple, efficient, and ideal for home automation or basic IoT applications.

Features
Voice-Controlled Commands: Recognizes specific spoken phrases to perform actions like turning a device ON or OFF.

Real-Time Execution: Continuously listens for voice commands and executes actions promptly.

Device Control: Operates devices connected to the GPIO pins of an embedded board.

User-Friendly Feedback: Provides console messages about the recognized command and its execution.

Components and Tools
Embedded Board: Raspberry Pi is used in the example, but the system can be adapted to other boards like Arduino or ESP32.

Microphone: Captures audio input for speech recognition.

Software Libraries:

SpeechRecognition: Converts spoken language into text.

RPi.GPIO: Controls GPIO pins on Raspberry Pi to manage connected devices.

System Workflow
Audio Capture:

The microphone captures the user's speech.

Speech Recognition:

Converts the audio input into text using the Google Speech-to-Text API (or an offline alternative).

Command Matching:

Matches the converted text against predefined commands.

Device Control:

Executes the corresponding action, such as toggling an LED, based on the matched command.

Applications
Home Automation: Control lights, fans, or other appliances using voice commands.

Accessibility Solutions: Assists users with disabilities by offering hands-free device control.

Educational Projects: Provides a foundation for learning about embedded systems, IoT, and speech recognition.

Limitations
Predefined Commands: Limited to recognizing specific phrases programmed into the system.

Noise Sensitivity: Performance may degrade in noisy environments without preprocessing.

Dependency on Internet: If using Google Speech-to-Text API, internet access is required.

This system provides a scalable and versatile base for further development into more advanced applications.
